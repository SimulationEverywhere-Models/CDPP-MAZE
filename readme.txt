Maze-Solving Cell-DEVS model

The files included in this distribution represent the Cell-DEVS maze solving
model.  There are 3 .ma files included, called maze1.ma, maze2.ma, and maze3.ma.
These represent three different mazes that are solved using Cell-DEVS.  They
represent:

maze1.ma -- typical execution and solving of a maze
maze2.ma -- a maze with no solution
maze3.ma -- a maze with multiple solution paths

These models can be run with the three provided batch files, maze1.bat, maze2.bat,
and maze3.bat.

Each batch file will execute the model, generate a .log file, a human-readable
output file (maze1.out, maze2.out, maze3.out) as well as a Graflog-readable
output file (maze1.drw, etc.)

A palette file maze.pal is also included.
